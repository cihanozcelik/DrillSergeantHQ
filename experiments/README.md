# Experiments

This folder contains **small, standalone experiments** meant for learning and de-risking parts of DrillSergeantHQ.

## Principles

- **Small surface area**: one idea per experiment.
- **Standalone**: each experiment can be run on its own.
- **Beginner-first**: the code is written to be readable and moddable.
- **Aligned with project constraints**: browser-first, `wgpu`/WebGPU allowed, core RL/math built in-house.

## Experiments list

- **PaddleBall Q-learning (WASM + wgpu scaffold)**: [`paddleball-qlearn-wasm/`](paddleball-qlearn-wasm/)
