# Glossary

- **Action repeat**: Using one action for multiple simulation steps to reduce inference frequency and stabilize control.
- **AoS / SoA**: Array of Structs vs Structure of Arrays. SoA is preferred for hot paths and GPU-friendly layouts.
- **Checkpoint**: A published snapshot of model weights suitable for hot-swapping or saving.
- **COOP/COEP**: HTTP headers enabling cross-origin isolation, required for SharedArrayBuffer and WASM threads.
- **GAE**: Generalized Advantage Estimation, computes advantages from rewards and values using \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\).
- **Hot-swap**: Replacing the policy weights used for inference without restarting the show simulation.
- **PPO**: Proximal Policy Optimization, an on-policy algorithm using a clipped surrogate objective for stability.
- **Rollout**: Experience generated by running the policy in an environment: obs/actions/rewards/dones/logprobs/values.
- **SAB**: SharedArrayBuffer, a shared memory region accessible by multiple workers/threads.
- **Show environment**: The single environment instance the user watches and interacts with; evaluation-only in v1.
- **Trainer**: The worker/subsystem that consumes rollouts, performs PPO updates, and publishes checkpoints.
