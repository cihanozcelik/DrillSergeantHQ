# Appendices

Appendices are where we pin down “reference material” that the narrative chapters rely on:

- glossary (shared vocabulary)
- diagrams (for re-orienting quickly)
- message schemas (draft contracts)
- buffer layouts (draft offsets/strides)
- math cheat sheet (PPO/GAE quick reference)
- roadmap (phases and definitions of done)

These pages are meant to be skimmed and revisited.
