# Part II — System Architecture

This part is the book’s **narrative glue**.

If you ever feel lost—if you ever ask *“what the hell is going on?”*—come back to the first chapter in this part: **the WTF map**. It traces one end-to-end “tick” through the system:

- a user action in the UI
- a simulation tick in the show match
- rollouts flowing into training
- a PPO update producing new weights
- those weights hot‑swapping into the show match

Everything else in this book is a zoom-in on one of those steps.
