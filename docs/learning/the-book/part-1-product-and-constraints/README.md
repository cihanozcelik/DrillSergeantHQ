# Part I — The Product and the Constraints

Every ambitious system starts with a promise.

In DrillSergeantHQ, the promise is not “PPO in the browser.” The promise is *experiential*:

> Run a live match, press **Train**, and watch the agent get better while you’re still watching.

Part I makes that promise explicit, then shows how browser constraints and design principles narrow the design space until the architecture almost chooses itself.
