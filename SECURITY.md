# Security Policy

DrillSergeantHQ is currently in an early documentation/learning phase.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue:

- **Do not** open a public issue with exploit details.
- Instead, send a private report to the maintainers via GitHub (preferred):
  - Open an issue with the title **"Security report"** and include **no sensitive details**, and ask for a private channel, **or**
  - Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting if enabled for the repository.

## Scope

- **In scope**: issues in any future code that could lead to RCE, XSS, data exfiltration, sandbox escapes, supply-chain compromise, or COOP/COEP misconfiguration guidance that creates real risk.
- **Out of scope (for now)**: theoretical issues in design documents without a working implementation.
